You need to configure this simple environment securely. Your first challenge is to set up appropriate firewall rules and virtual machine tags.
You also need to ensure that SSH is only available to the bastion via IAP.

For the firewall rules, make sure:

The bastion host does not have a public IP address.
You can only SSH to the bastion and only via IAP.
You can only SSH to juice-shop via the bastion.
Only HTTP is open to the world for juice-shop.
Tips and tricks:

Pay close attention to the network tags and the associated VPC firewall rules.
Be specific and limit the size of the VPC firewall rule source ranges.
Overly permissive permissions will not be marked correct.


Solving tasks

Task 1: Check the firewall rules. Remove the overly permissive rules.

  1. Go to VPC network > Firewall > will see open-access
  2. Use the following command from the cloud console:
  3. gcloud compute firewall-rules delete open-access

Task 2: Navigate to Compute Engine in the Cloud Console and identify the bastion host. The instance should be stopped. Start the instance

  1. Go to Compute Engine > VM Instances > Select bastion > click on Start

Task 3: The bastion host is the one machine authorized to receive external SSH traffic.
Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service.The firewall rule should be enabled on bastion via a network tag.
Run the following:
Make sure you replace with the tag provided on the Left Pane.

   1. gcloud compute firewall-rules create <SSH IAP network tag> --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 35.235.240.0/20 --target-tags <SSH IAP network tag> --network acme-vpc

   gcloud compute instances add-tags bastion --tags=<SSH IAP network tag> --zone=us-central1-b

Task 4: The juice-shop server serves HTTP traffic. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address. 
The firewall rule should be enabled on juice-shop via a network tag
Run the following:
Make sure you replace with the tag provided on the Left Pane.

  1. gcloud compute firewall-rules create <HTTP network tag> --allow=tcp:80 --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags <HTTP network tag> --network acme-vpc

  gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=<HTTP network tag> --zone=us-central1-b

Task 5: You need to connect to juice-shop from the bastion using SSH. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address. The firewall rule should be enabled on juice-shop via a network tag
Run the following:
Make sure you replace with the tag provided on the Left Pane.

  1. gcloud compute firewall-rules create <SSH internal network tag> --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 192.168.10.0/24 --target-tags <SSH internal network tag> --network acme-vpc

  gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=<SSH internal network tag> --zone=us-central1-b

Task 6: In the Compute Engine instances page, click the SSH button for the bastion host. Once connected, SSH to juice-shop

 1. Go to Compute Engine > VM instances > SSH to bastion host
 2. Run the following:
 3. ssh <internal IP of the juice-shop>
